LH Fresh Content checks if the page visitted is stale (or has been updated) and updates it in the background or alerts the visitor.

This plugins checks (in the backround) if the current page is out of date. If the current page is active the user is sent a message alerting them the page is out of date and givig them the option to refresh the page.

If the page is in the background the page is refreshed automatically.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work on single pages or archives or both=
Both.

= Doe this plugin work on the homepage? =

It does, but if you have a static homepage set it will only update of that page has been editted. Dynamic content e.g. generated by shortcodes etc is not monitored.

= Where does the stale content alert appear? =

If the tab is in the background there is no alert, the tab will simply be refreshed. If the tab is currently focussed by default it will appear as the first child element of the first <main> element. This behaviour can be adjusted in Settings->Reading area.

= What if something does not work?  =

LH Fresh Content, and all [https://lhero.org](LocalHero) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfifteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-fresh-content/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-fresh-content/) . I look there regularly and resolve most queries.
